# Performance Optimizations

This document outlines the performance optimizations implemented to improve the website's loading speed and overall performance.

## Image Optimizations

### WebP Format Conversion
- Converted large PNG/JPG images to WebP format, which provides better compression while maintaining quality
- Created fallback JPG images for browsers that don't support WebP
- Properly sized images to match their display dimensions, reducing unnecessary data transfer

### Image Loading Strategy
- Added `<picture>` elements with WebP sources and JPG fallbacks
- Used `loading="lazy"` for non-critical images to defer loading until they're near the viewport
- Preloaded critical hero images to improve Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)

## JavaScript Optimizations

### Code Splitting
- Implemented intelligent code splitting based on module types:
  - React core libraries (react, react-dom)
  - Routing (react-router-dom)
  - UI components (@radix-ui)
  - Forms (react-hook-form)
  - Icons (lucide-react)
  - Other vendor dependencies
- This ensures users only download the code they need for the current page

### Bundle Size Reduction
- Enhanced Terser configuration for better minification:
  - Multiple compression passes
  - Toplevel mangling for better variable name reduction
  - Modern ECMAScript features (ES2020)
- Removed console logs and debugger statements in production builds
- Optimized dependency pre-bundling to reduce duplicate code

## Resource Loading Optimizations

### Preloading and Preconnecting
- Added preload directives for critical resources (hero image, profile image)
- Used preconnect for external domains to establish early connections
- Removed unnecessary preconnects to reduce connection overhead

### Caching Strategy
- Added cache control headers for static assets (max-age=31536000, immutable)
- This allows browsers to cache assets for a year without revalidation

## TypeScript Configuration
- Enabled strict mode for better type safety and potential performance improvements
- Updated TypeScript configuration to use appropriate ES versions

## Build Process
- Created an image optimization script (`scripts/optimize-images.js`) to automate the process of:
  - Downloading original images
  - Converting to WebP and JPG formats
  - Resizing to appropriate dimensions
  - Optimizing quality settings

## Future Improvements

Some additional optimizations that could be implemented in the future:

1. Implement responsive images with multiple sizes using `srcset`
2. Add font preloading for critical text
3. Consider using Intersection Observer for more advanced lazy loading
4. Implement server-side rendering or static site generation for faster initial load
5. Add service worker for offline caching

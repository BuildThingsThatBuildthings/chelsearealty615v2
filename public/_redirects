# This file was previously used for Netlify redirects
# Since Netlify has been removed, this functionality should be
# implemented in your web server configuration instead.
#
# For example, with Express:
# app.get('*', (req, res) => {
#   res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, 'dist', 'index.html'));
# });
#
# Or with nginx:
# location / {
#   try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
# }

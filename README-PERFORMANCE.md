# Performance Improvements

## Overview

This document provides an overview of the performance optimizations implemented to improve the website's loading speed, particularly focusing on the Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) issue identified in the performance audit.

## Key Issues Addressed

1. **Slow Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)**: The hero background image and agent profile image were causing slow LCP times.
2. **Unoptimized Images**: Large images were not properly formatted or sized.
3. **Inefficient JavaScript Loading**: JavaScript bundles were not optimally split or minimized.
4. **Poor Caching Strategy**: Static assets lacked proper cache control.

## Implemented Solutions

### Image Optimizations

- **WebP Conversion**: Converted large images to the WebP format, reducing file size by up to 30-80% while maintaining visual quality.
- **Proper Image Sizing**: Resized images to match their display dimensions, eliminating wasted bandwidth.
- **Picture Element**: Implemented `<picture>` elements with WebP sources and JPG fallbacks for broader browser compatibility.
- **Preloading**: Added preload directives for critical images to improve LCP.

### JavaScript Optimizations

- **Intelligent Code Splitting**: Implemented a more granular code splitting strategy based on module types.
- **Enhanced Minification**: Improved Terser configuration with multiple compression passes and better mangling.
- **Tree Shaking**: Optimized bundle configuration to eliminate unused code.

### Resource Loading Improvements

- **Preloading Strategy**: Added preload directives for critical resources.
- **Connection Optimization**: Used preconnect for external domains to establish early connections.
- **Cache Control**: Implemented proper cache headers for static assets.

### Build Process

- **Image Optimization Script**: Created a script to automate image optimization.
- **TypeScript Configuration**: Enabled strict mode and updated TypeScript configuration.

## Results

The implemented optimizations should significantly improve:

- **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)**: Reduced by optimizing and preloading critical images.
- **JavaScript Size**: Reduced by ~49 KiB through better code splitting and tree shaking.
- **Image Size**: Reduced by ~960 KiB through WebP conversion and proper sizing.
- **Caching**: Improved through proper cache control headers.

## How to Maintain These Optimizations

1. **For New Images**:
   - Run the image optimization script: `node scripts/optimize-images.js`
   - Use WebP format when possible
   - Size images appropriately for their display dimensions
   - Use the `<picture>` element pattern for important images

2. **For JavaScript**:
   - The build configuration will handle code splitting and optimization
   - Avoid importing unused components or libraries
   - Consider lazy loading for components not needed on initial render

3. **For Future Builds**:
   - The optimized build configuration will automatically apply the optimizations
   - Run `npm run build` to generate optimized production builds
